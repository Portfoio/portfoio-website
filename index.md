    faq:
      - question: What makes gendriven different from a robo-adviser?
        answer: Robo-advisors are automatized asset managers that usually only provide a “one-size-fits-all” solution. gendriven on the other hand is a software for investors who want to build and manage their portfolio themselves. Whether you have prior knowledge or are a first time investor, the app will be your co-pilot to assist you with your investments. With an asset manager you delegate all the decisions - with us you are the one who decides what assets you want to buy.
      - question: How does gendriven find optimal assets?
        answer: gendriven values the assets on the basis of past performance. That is, how big the fluctuations in value were and how high the profit was. In addition, how the assets harmonize and balance each other as a whole portfolio.
      - question: Which assets or products does gendriven use?
        answer: Generated portfolios can consist of stocks and/or ETFs (more coming soon, crypto friends 😏). You can decide yourself from what your portfolios will be generated. 
      - question: What are ETFs?
        answer: ETFs track the performance of stock market indices, i.e. combine the performance of several companies - in contrast to individual stocks, which track a specific value. The aim of an ETF is to achieve the same return as the index it tracks.
      - question: What is diversification?
        answer: With any asset, there is a risk that it will lose value in the future. This is the individual risk. For this reason, you should not invest all your assets in one asset.<br/>To minimize the risk, gendriven always generates portfolios of assets from different industries and countries. This way you are not dependent on the success of a single company.
